Create a empty DB (running app.js creates it)

Inside the `database` folder:
-Run 'npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all' to populate DB with demo data
-Run 'npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all' to remove demo data

If you want the service to send mails to your own address, change email address in demoUser file before populate the DB (email addresses need to be unique)
